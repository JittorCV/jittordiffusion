[Jittor](https://github.com/Jittor/jittor) implementation of **[PhotoMaker: Customizing Realistic Human Photos via Stacked ID Embedding](https://huggingface.co/papers/2312.04461)**.


### üå†  **Key Feature:**

Experience the **Jittor** version of Photomaker just like the original PyTorch version, but with even greater speed and convenience.

## üö© **TODO/Updates**
- [x] Realistic generation 
- [ ] Stylization generation

---

## üî• **Examples**


### Realistic generation 


- [**PhotoMaker notebook demo**](photomaker_demo.ipynb)

We can see that whether it‚Äôs generating an Iron Man Newton image with Photomaker or creating a multi-color style image of Scarlett Johansson, the Jittor version **delivers the same quality** as the PyTorch version. Both versions produce images that are *imaginative and diverse*. 

Additionally, the Jittor version offers **enhanced performance**, making the image generation process faster and more efficient. This improvement allows users to create stunning visuals with greater ease and speed, without compromising on the **artistic creativity and variety** that Photomaker is known for.

### Stylization generation 

Stylization generation is currently unavailable due to compatibility issues with Jittor. We will address this in a future update.


# üîß Dependencies and Installation

- Python = 3.9 (Recommend to use [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/#linux) or [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html))
- JDiffusion: 
```bash
conda create --name photomaker python=3.9
conda activate photomaker

# Install requirements
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Install photomaker
cd example/photomaker
pip install -e .

```

Then you can run the following command to use it
```python
from photomaker import PhotoMakerStableDiffusionXLPipeline
```

# ‚è¨ Download Models 
The model will be automatically downloaded through the following two lines:

```python
from huggingface_hub import hf_hub_download
photomaker_path = hf_hub_download(repo_id="TencentARC/PhotoMaker", filename="photomaker-v1.bin", repo_type="model")
```

You can also choose to download manually from this [url](https://huggingface.co/TencentARC/PhotoMaker).

# üíª How to Test

## Use like [diffusers](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers)

- Dependency
```py
import torch
import os
from diffusers.utils import load_image
from diffusers import EulerDiscreteScheduler
from photomaker import PhotoMakerStableDiffusionXLPipeline

### Load base model
pipe = PhotoMakerStableDiffusionXLPipeline.from_pretrained(
    base_model_path,  # can change to any base model based on SDXL
    torch_dtype=torch.bfloat16, 
    use_safetensors=True, 
    variant="fp16"
).to(device)

### Load PhotoMaker checkpoint
pipe.load_photomaker_adapter(
    os.path.dirname(photomaker_path),
    subfolder="",
    weight_name=os.path.basename(photomaker_path),
    trigger_word="img"  # define the trigger word
)     

pipe.scheduler = EulerDiscreteScheduler.from_config(pipe.scheduler.config)

### Also can cooperate with other LoRA modules
# pipe.load_lora_weights(os.path.dirname(lora_path), weight_name=lora_model_name, adapter_name="xl_more_art-full")
# pipe.set_adapters(["photomaker", "xl_more_art-full"], adapter_weights=[1.0, 0.5])

pipe.fuse_lora()
```

- Input ID Images
```py
### define the input ID images
input_folder_name = './examples/newton_man'
image_basename_list = os.listdir(input_folder_name)
image_path_list = sorted([os.path.join(input_folder_name, basename) for basename in image_basename_list])

input_id_images = []
for image_path in image_path_list:
    input_id_images.append(load_image(image_path))
```

- Generation
```py
# Note that the trigger word `img` must follow the class word for personalization
prompt = "a half-body portrait of a man img wearing the sunglasses in Iron man suit, best quality"
negative_prompt = "(asymmetry, worst quality, low quality, illustration, 3d, 2d, painting, cartoons, sketch), open mouth, grayscale"
generator = torch.Generator(device=device).manual_seed(42)
images = pipe(
    prompt=prompt,
    input_id_images=input_id_images,
    negative_prompt=negative_prompt,
    num_images_per_prompt=1,
    num_inference_steps=num_steps,
    start_merge_step=10,
    generator=generator,
).images[0]
gen_images.save('out_photomaker.png')
```

</p>


## Start a local gradio demo
Run the following command:

```python
python gradio_demo/app.py
```

You could customize this script in [this file](gradio_demo/app.py).

If you want to run it on MAC, you should follow [this Instruction](MacGPUEnv.md) and then run the app.py.

## Usage Tips:
- Upload more photos of the person to be customized to improve ID fidelity. If the input is Asian face(s), maybe consider adding 'Asian' before the class word, e.g., `Asian woman img`
- When stylizing, does the generated face look too realistic? Adjust the Style strength to 30-50, the larger the number, the less ID fidelity, but the stylization ability will be better. You could also try out other base models or LoRAs with good stylization effects.
- Reduce the number of generated images and sampling steps for faster speed. However, please keep in mind that reducing the sampling steps may compromise the ID fidelity.
