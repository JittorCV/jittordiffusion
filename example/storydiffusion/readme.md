### ðŸŒ   **Key Features:**
StoryDiffusion can create a magic story by generating consistent images and videos. Our work mainly has two parts: 
1. Consistent self-attention for character-consistent image generation over long-range sequences. It is hot-pluggable and compatible with all SD1.5 and SDXL-based image diffusion models. For the current implementation, the user needs to provide at least 3 text prompts for the consistent self-attention module. We recommend at least 5 - 6 text prompts for better layout arrangement.
2. Motion predictor for long-range video generation, which predicts motion between Condition Images in a compressed image semantic space, achieving larger motion prediction. 



## ðŸ”¥ **Examples**

### Comics generation 

#### In this work, we transitioned the framework from PyTorch to Jittor. There are no significant differences between them, and this is the resulting output:

#### with the prompt
["wake up in the bed",
                "have breakfast",
                "is on the road, go to the company",
                "work in the company",
]

#### with the prompt

["running in the playground",
                "reading book in the home",
                "siting on the sofa",
                "on the bed, at night "
]
